1- The labs we did helped me to complete the code using the counting sort algorithm.
2- This was also similar to what we did in lab 2.
3- I was able to use merge sort in order to get the demanded output.
4- This was easy to complete, I used iteration to solve this.
5- The radix sort took the most time. However, i was able to debug my code and get the expected output.
6- After solving the previous problem. This problem was simliar, i just changed few things.
7- I did not have a hard time solving this problem.
8- This was easy, i just used quick sort to solve the problem.
