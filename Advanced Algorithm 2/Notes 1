1- This code defines a function num_squares(n) to determine the fewest perfect square numbers required to sum up to a
given positive integer n. It starts by generating a list of perfect squares up to the square root of n.
Then, it initiates a queue with the initial number n and steps set to 0. Utilizing a breadth-first search approach,
 it explores all possible combinations of perfect squares subtracted from the current number,
 updating the queue with the new numbers and their corresponding steps. If a combination equals 0,
 indicating the target sum is achieved, it returns the number of steps taken.
 If no combination results in the target sum, it returns -1.

 2- There is a mistake in the output. It should be 11 not 6. The shortestPath function calculates the shortest path
 length between a given start and destination point in a maze represented as a 2D grid.
  I utilizes breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.
  The function first checks if the start or destination point is invalid (i.e., it's a blocked cell in the maze).
  If so, it returns -1 indicating there's no valid path.
  Then, it initializes a queue with the start position and distance set to 0.
  It iterates through the queue until it's empty, dequeuing positions and their corresponding distances.
  For each position, it explores all possible directions (down, up, right, left),
  checks if the new position is valid (within the maze boundaries and not blocked),
  and if so, adds it to the queue with an incremented distance. If the destination is reached, it returns the distance.
  If no valid path is found, it returns -1.

  3- for this I used radix_sort(arr): This function implements the radix sort algorithm to sort a list of strings (arr).
   It first finds the maximum length among all strings in the list. Then, it iterates from the last character position
   to the first character position. Then I used the exist(board, word): This function checks whether a given word can
    be formed by concatenating characters from adjacent cells on a 2D board. It utilizes depth-first search (DFS) to
    explore all possible paths on the board. Before starting the search, it sorts the characters of the word
    using radix_sort. Then, it iterates over each cell in the board and performs DFS from that cell,
    attempting to form the given word. If a valid path is found, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

 4- In the tropical_sort function:
It first determines the length of the input list arr.
Then, it iterates over each element of the list using two nested loops. For each element at index i,
it compares it with all elements from index i+1 onwards.
If it finds an element arr[j] that is smaller than arr[i], it swaps the positions of these elements.
This process continues until the entire list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

5- In the dijkstra function:
It initializes a dictionary distances to store the shortest distance from the start node to each node in the graph.
Initially, all distances are set to infinity except for the start node, which is set to 0.
It initializes an empty set visited to keep track of visited nodes.
It iterates until all nodes have been visited.
In each iteration, it finds the node with the smallest distance that has not been visited yet.
If there are multiple nodes with the same smallest distance, it chooses arbitrarily.
It adds the selected node to the set of visited nodes.
It updates the distances to neighbors of the current node if a shorter path is found.
Finally, it returns the shortest distance from the start node to the end node.

6- The modified dijkstra function now utilizes a priority queue to optimize the Dijkstra's algorithm implementation.
Instead of sorting the priority queue every time, it maintains the queue in a sorted manner:

The priority queue pq is initialized with tuples containing the distance and the node (0, start).
Two helper functions, push and pop, are defined to add elements to and remove elements from the priority queue.
The main loop runs until the priority queue is empty.In each iteration, it dequeues the node with the smallest distance.
It then checks if the distance to the current node is greater than the known shortest distance.If so, it skips the node.
It explores neighbors of the current node, calculates the distance to each neighbor,
and updates the shortest distance if a shorter path is found.
After the loop completes, it prints the shortest distances to each vertex.
